## Project Description  
This project focuses on analyzing HR employee data to uncover key insights and trends. The dataset includes information on employees across various departments, covering demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition, and more.  

SQL was used to explore the data, answer key business questions, and derive actionable insights.  

## Dataset  
- **File Name:** Analyzing Employee Trends.csv  
- **Contents:** Employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition data, and other HR-related metrics.  

## Tasks Performed  
- Conducted **data exploration and validation** to ensure accuracy.  
- Wrote **SQL queries** to analyze employee counts, averages, and distributions across various dimensions (e.g., department, age, education).  
- Identified **top job roles and satisfaction levels** within each department.  
- Calculated **employee attrition rates** by age bands to identify high-risk groups.  
- Analyzed **factors influencing attrition**, such as age, education, and job satisfaction.  
- Compared **averages and aggregates** across different employee segments.  
- Identified **top and bottom performers** based on satisfaction and attrition metrics.  
- Utilized **SQL techniques** including JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and CASE statements for complex analysis.  
- Organized findings into a structured format for **leadership decision-making**.  

## SQL Techniques Used  
- **JOINs** – To combine multiple tables for deeper insights.  
- **GROUP BY & HAVING** – To aggregate and filter grouped data.  
- **CASE Statements** – To categorize employees based on conditions.  
- **Aggregations (AVG, COUNT, SUM, etc.)** – To analyze trends and comparisons.  

## Key Insights  
- Identified **high attrition risk groups** based on age and job satisfaction.  
- Highlighted **departments with the highest and lowest satisfaction levels**.  
- Pinpointed **job roles with high turnover rates** for further HR intervention.  
- Provided **data-driven recommendations** to improve retention and employee satisfaction.  

## Conclusion  
This analysis provides valuable insights for HR teams to enhance employee retention strategies, improve job satisfaction, and optimize workforce planning.
